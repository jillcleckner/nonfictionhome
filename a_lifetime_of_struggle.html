                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mbr-white display-7">I held my report card in my hand detailing the first marking period of my seventh-grade year. Dread builds up inside me as I take my pencil and change the E to a B.  Maybe they won’t notice, I told myself.  They noticed.  My social life came to a screeching halt until the next report card was sent home six weeks later. And then it still didn’t change. <br><br> You are lazy, they screamed at me. <br><br>You do just enough to get by, my dad frowned at me. <br><br>You need to try harder, my mom hissed at me. <br><br> They wouldn’t listen.  I told them that the information just won’t stay in my head. I forget what the teachers say almost immediately after I hear it.   <br><br>I can remember sitting at the kitchen table with my math book spread open before me, pencil with the eraser scrubbed down to the metal cylinder that encircled it, gripped tightly in my hand.  I wanted to snap it in half.  My mom’s fist banging the table as she again screamed at me that six times eight is 48.  Tears slid down my cheeks.  I felt that I must be the dumbest kid in my class.  Back then there was no ADHD or dyslexia.  You were just labeled dumb. <br><br> Middle school and high school proved to be a continuous cycle of disappointing report cards, disappointing my parents, and me hating myself because I was dumb.  I graduated by the skin of my teeth with great relief that my days of being a failure were over.  I couldn’t have been more wrong! <br><br> “No, we will not pay for you to go to cosmetology school,” they told me.  “You will enroll in classes at Delta College, we will pay for that.” I thought going to cosmetology school was the answer to my struggles.  I could learn how to do something with my hands.  They made it seem like I had just told them I wanted to be an exotic dancer.  Socially unacceptable.  <br><br> So, I “enrolled.”  Twelve credit hours.  My schedule dictated that I be in class every day at 8 in the morning.  What I discovered was there was no accountability in college.  The instructors didn’t care if I showed up for class.  I had no interest in sitting in classes.  I got up and left the house every morning but it wasn’t to sit in a classroom.   <br><br> A year later I found myself moving across the country with my boyfriend.  It was my way out from under the blanket of failure that covered me. I would no longer have to look at my parents disappointed faces every day. <br><br> Then, finally, I found something I was good at!  Being a mom.  After my first son was born I didn’t look back.  I didn’t think ahead either.  I was so focused on giving my kids all of me that I forgot about me.    <br><br> Ten years later I found myself a single parent who was unable to support herself and two kids. I moved back in with my parents with my tail between my legs.  I failed again.  This was my light bulb moment.  I needed a college degree unless I wanted to be a waitress or cashier for the rest of my life.   <br><br> This time it was different. I was paying my own tuition.  I taught myself how to study so that I retained what I was taught.  I worked my ass off. My first semester I earned the distinction of being on the President’s List.  I had a 4.0 semester!   <br><br> Fast forward to 2017: <br><br>Each new semester I walk into the classroom and mentally confirm that I am the oldest person sliding into a seat in this room for the next 15 weeks.     <br><br>I am almost 50 years old. <br><br>I still have a fourteen-year-old at home. <br><br>I am fifteen credit hours away from my B.A. degree. <br><br>I have a job that I love but it is contingent on my being enrolled in secondary education. <br><br>I have more life experience than most students graduating from college entering the workforce. <br><br>My resume screams that I am not a Millennial fresh out of college.   <br><br>I think about my competition in the job market. <br><br>Surely, I won’t be picked over someone with less life experience.  Someone that has many years in the workforce ahead of them.  <br><br> I struggle daily with my decision to drop out of community college to become a mom. Was it worth it to give so much of myself to my kids, that now as they don’t need me like they once did, I find myself competing in the job market with those who are the same age as my own kids. I often tell my fourteen-year-old daughter that my biggest hope for her is that no matter what she decides to do with her life she needs to not forget that she is a person too.  If she decides to be a mom her kids won’t always need all of her.  Make sure she looks ahead.  As I write this I realize that life is like a business plan.  You must not fail to plan for the future.  If you do, you might regret it.</p>
