                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mbr-white display-7">Ever wonder what’s hiding inside those gym walls? Who’s inside those gym walls? Is it intimidating inside those gym walls?  Is it really filled with Popeye like muscular guys walking around, strutting their stuff? Are the fitness instructors former military drill sergeants?  Does it stink like sweat and dirty socks?  Why do people go there? <br><br>Some people go to forget about their problems for a while, relieve stress, because their doctor told them to, or because their friend shamed them into joining them for a yoga or spin class that they now regret taking part in.  It’s January, the busiest month at the gym.  All the New Year’s resolutioners are here sporting brand new workout clothes, gripping trendy new sport bottles filled with water.  An array of colorful bags concealing wrinkled work clothes and protein bars dot the floor along the wall.  Winter coats line the wall, hanging limply on hooks, waiting eagerly to go home.   <br><br>The hum of noise washes over you like a giant wave.  There are kids shouting, shoes squeeking on the gym floor, balls bouncing, weights clanking together, music and shouting coming from the spin room, people talking, feet pounding on the black belts of the treadmills.  The sounds of people being active. <br><br>The oval walking track that sits like a misshapen halo above the gym floor looks like a crowded highway at rush hour.  The serious track-goers stand out from the others.  Their brisk pace reveals a purpose as they weave in and out, making their way through the less determined.  Some walk in pairs, some alone.  The loners have their smart phones tucked into a little plastic pocket that is secured to their arm with a circle of velcro.  The cord transporting music, or maybe a podcast, from their device to their ears, snakes up their back.  Their wrists are encircled with colorful fitness tracking devices that will report to them how many steps they have taken and how fast their heart is beating.  They keep walking in ovals. Even days they go clock wise and odd days they go counter clockwise.  There is no destination, maybe a target goal has mentally been set.  Will they reach it?  Only they will know.   <br><br>The gym floor below is filled with people of all ages.  The sound of basketballs being thrust repeatedly against the shiny wood floor sounds like popcorn popping at the movie theater.  People dot the bleachers as they watch ten-year-old boys run in packs chasing the basketball up and down the court.  Every now and then a hopeful heaves the ball toward the basket hoping it will fall through the net.  The coach is yelling “Gooooooooooo!!!!” as he points to the other end of the court where the ball now is, the pack of boys seems frozen as they look at him, unsure of what to do. The sharp shrill of the referee’s whistle pierces the air, the boys all retreat to the bench and grab their water bottles.   <br><br>The window-lined turf room is filled with women of all ages and fitness levels.  Muscular, burly men are leading a self-defense class.  The women all stand in a messy semi-circle around the men and listen as they stress the importance of being able to protect themselves if the situation ever presents itself.  Soon they pair off, one holds a thick, rectangular pad in front of her chest while her partner punches it.  Some are more aggressive than others.  There is a pair that look to be about 65 years old.  One takes a timid swing at the black pad and almost misses, they both bend over in laughter. They compose themselves, she tried again, they dissolve into more laughter.   <br><br>In the fitness room, treadmills are lined up like soldiers facing the windows, looking out on the track and down onto the gym floor.  They are all occupied with people at different stages of their workout.  Some are red faced and gasping for air, their faces reveal that this not something they do with any regularity.  Their feet moving impossibly fast to keep up with the rotating belt beneath them.  Others bounce along like it’s no big deal, occasionally dragging a small white towel across their faces to remove the sweat. One is walking at a turtle’s pace reading a book.  The rhythmic beat of soles of their shoes on the rotating belt of the treadmill is almost comforting.  There is a young lady standing in front of a weight machine covering the huge yawn that is escaping from her mouth.  The counter attendant is folding a basket of clean towels.  <br><br>The back of the gym is filled with men and women pushing cast iron disks on bars into the air.  Some using their shoulders to rest the bar on, some lying on their backs on uncomfortable looking black benches.  A woman is on her back on one of those benches gripping a dumbbell in each hand, the number eight is marked on the ends of the dumbbells.  She is holding the dumbbells over her chest reaching for the ceiling.  The dumb bells trace a wobbly, imaginary line of a semicircle.  She now looks like the letter T.  One of the guys lifting weights sees her, sets his 30 pound dumbbells on the floor and makes his way over to her.  He explains to her that her arms are wobbly because she does not have enough weight in her hands.  He selects 15’s from the rack and talks her through a couple of reps.  “That is better,” she says smiling gratefully at him.   “If you ever need help, just ask,” he tells her as he goes back to his own lifting.  <br><br>A yoga class is going on in a dimly lit room.  Women are lying on their backs on colorful foam mats looking up at the ceiling.  Some are barefoot, some have socks on.  They are breathing and stretching and bending as the instructor is verbally guiding them.  Soothing instrumental music is coming from the speakers overhead.  Some are able to hold the poses longer than others. “That’s ok,” the instructor tells the class, “move at your own pace.  If you need to take a break, then take one.  This is your workout.” <br><br>Often times there is a stigma attached to gyms.  Don’t accept that stigma, take a step inside, you might find that it isn’t what you think. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
