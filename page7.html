His eyes drank in her every move, wishing he could talk her out of that dress right now. He had been waiting for this day for almost six years. He wanted to take her hand, lead her right out of there, and not look back. As she closed the distance between them his heart beat faster with anticipation.  She took her place at the front of the chapel.  Vows were said, rings were exchanged, the bride and groom kissed and turned to face the room full of family and friends.  They made their way out of the chapel hand in hand with the wedding party following behind. The overcast fall day did nothing to dampen their excitement.</em><br></p><br><p>That was twenty-one years ago.  <br>They met while working at the same restaurant a couple years after high school.  He wasted no time asking her out when her longtime boyfriend broke up with her.  They spent a lot of time together the next couple months smiling, laughing, talking, and loving.  Little did they know their adventure was going to map a route neither of them had imagined for themselves.  <br></p><br><p>“I’m leaving,” she told him as they sat in her car on a chilly April night. She didn't have to explain further. He knew exactly what she was saying. <br>He looked at her with questions his eyes, “He cheated on you.  What about all the things he did to you?"<br>	She wasn’t hearing him.  Her heart was set on getting out of this town. <br></p><br><p>They keep in touch sporadically that first year, he would call her while her husband was at work and they would talk like old friends.  Soon her husband's job took her overseas, she had a baby by then, the calls had stopped.  He must have moved on with his life she told herself while she tried to make the best of hers.  This was her choice after all, she had to make the best of it.  This wasn’t the life she imagined, she never bargained for the hurtful words, the infidelity, the lies.  She wanted desperately for her marriage to work so she stayed, not wanting to admit failure, afraid she couldn’t make it financially on her own with two young kids.  She thought of him often over those years.  Just as often as he thought about her.<br></p><br><p>He felt like he was getting nowhere fast in life, working several jobs, never seeming to get ahead. He decided to go to college, get a degree, make some decent money.  He immersed himself in college life, taking seventeen credit hours a semester so he could finish sooner rather than later.  He was getting on with his life because she was getting on with hers.  <br></p><br><p>There were times when he really missed her, he longed to hear her voice.  He had convinced her best friend to give him her International phone number, he had been carrying it in his wallet for quite some time.  One night after drinking a little too much he found himself at a payphone at 3 am with a handful of quarters. He wasn’t sure of the time difference.  All he knew is he missed her and he was going to call her and tell her he loved her.  He hadn’t heard her voice in several years.  The alcohol wouldn’t let him wait any longer.  He fed the quarters into the phone, drunkenly punched in the numbers written on the tattered paper but the fucking operator kept telling him the call could not be completed as dialed.  He kept trying and trying. He never did get to hear her voice that night. <br></p><br><p>She was excited, she was finally moving back to the states.  The timing couldn’t have been better, her best friend was getting married, she would see friends she hadn’t seen in a few years.  He would be there too.  She was nervous and excited about seeing him again.  She hadn’t seen him in almost six years.  God she hoped her hot head husband would behave and not wreck the day.  <br></p><br><p>He watched her make her way slowly up the aisle toward him.  His eyes drank in her every move, wishing he could talk her out of that dress right now. He had been waiting for this day for almost six years. He wanted to take her hand, lead her right out of there, and not look back. He still missed her. As she closed the distance between them his heart beat faster with anticipation.  He placed his hand on the breast pocket of his tux, he could feel the note he had tucked inside of it earlier in the day.  He was hoping to find a moment alone with her so he could press it into her hand.<br></p><br><p>She could feel his eyes on her as she made her way up the aisle. He was already at the front of the chapel with the other groomsmen.  She tried desperately not to make eye contact with him, she knew if she did there would be hell to pay later.  Her husband was watching her like a hawk, ready to swoop in and create havoc if he caught her looking at him.  He was unreasonably jealous that the groomsman that stood at the front of the chapel had slept with his wife before they were married.  <br></p><br><p>She took her place next to the bride. The day went unmarred, even at the reception where there was no shortage of beer and alcohol.  She was always aware of his presence.   Silently wishing that he would find her and whisk her away from her unhappy marriage, but that only happened in the movies she told herself.  She had no idea he had a note in his pocket for her that said, “I love you.  Call me.”  <br></p><br><p>He never got a chance to discreetly give her that note.  Once again they went on their separate ways to live their lives.  Each carrying unspoken desires for the other.  It would be another ten years before they found each other again.  They always seemed to find each other.  This time it was with the help of the Internet. An email exchanged a couple of times a year where she worked hard to make her life sound perfect… when really it wasn’t.  A handful of emails and Facebook messages got them through the next ten years.  Just old lovers catching up, that’s what she always told herself as she wondered what life would have been like had she not chose to leave all those years ago.  She once asked him why he hadn’t tried harder to stop her from leaving.  “The heart knows what the heart wants, I knew you had a history with him, I knew you had to go.” He told her.  She had always wished he had tried harder to stop her from leaving. She wanted someone to love her that much.  Little did she know he really did.  <br></p><br><p>She never expected that twenty-seven years after she told him she was leaving they would be slowly rekindling a flame that had been smoldering all those years.  The more they talked the bigger the flame grew.  She tried to deny it oxygen but was failing miserably.  She finally agreed to meet with him.  They sat and talked for hours.  She couldn’t take her eyes off of him. The smile never left his face.   <br></p><br><p>When it was time to part ways he wrapped his arms gently around her.  She fell into his embrace with ease, clinging to him tightly, not wanting the moment to end.  This embrace was the cumulation of all the years that had slipped by them as a result of one decision made in haste.  They both carried the weight of that decision with them on their solitary journeys through life.  A course that led them both here today, once again saying good-bye, not knowing what would come next.  <br></p><br><p>As she reluctantly released her arms from around him, her lips found his.  In that quiet moment nothing else mattered; she was nineteen years old again. She didn’t know how a single moment could transport her whole body back to another time but it was happening with this soft kiss that was delightfully tender, warm and silky. She had forgotten how incredible his lips felt.  She wanted to stay in this moment forever.<br></p><br><p>They knew they couldn’t change the past but they had the future in front of them.  Just what to do with it, neither of them knew.  They were both in other relationships.  She shook her head as she told him good-bye. She knew there was no way she could turn her life upside down to take a chance on what might have been.  He took her hands in his, afraid to let her slip away again.  Their eyes met and he smiled at her.  She wanted to walk away but she couldn’t, something she couldn’t explain was holding her here. She looked down at their hands as her heart told her what she needed to do.  <br></p><br><p>As she drove away that afternoon she told herself that she could not do this.  She had to stop.  Bust she found that she couldn’t stop thinking about how he made her heart smile.  How good it felt to be near him, to see the smile in his hazel eyes when he looked at her.  She was unable to resist the pull he had on her heart. <br>He smiled the whole way home that day.  He had waited almost twenty-one years to be near her again.  He found himself thinking about her more and more as the fall air grew crisper.  “I’m going to give you that note one day, I promise,” he told her. “I love you.”  It felt good to finally tell her the words he had been holding inside forever.  <br>She knew from that moment her heart belonged to him.  She too had been holding those words inside.  Afraid if she said them out loud it she would wake up from the happiest dream she had ever had, only this wasn’t a dream. This was real.  <br></p><br><p>As the days grew shorter and colder their relationship bloomed.  She longed to see him again. They managed to find some time one December afternoon.  She sat cross legged on the bed across from him as they spent the afternoon with the rest of the world shut out.  She could listen to him talk for hours.  She wished time would stand still when they were together, instead it sped by.  “I love you,” she whispered into his ear as they parted ways. He wanted to lift her into his arms, take her to the bed and make love to her.  He respected her too much for that. He knew she wasn’t ready to cross that line.  <br></p><br><p>They fell deeper in love as the days grew shorter.  They began planning a future together.  They both knew getting there wouldn’t be easy.  They were both still in other relationships.   “Will you wait for me?” she asked him.  “Of course I’ll wait for you, I’ve been waiting my whole adult life for you, no way I’m walking away now,” he said with a smile.  <br></p><br><p>She never expected this.  She never expected to be planning a future with him.  She was excited about the future.  “I’m so thankful we found each other again.” she told him.  She had never been more sure of anything in her life.  They were given this second chance.  A second chance to get it right.  <br></p><br><p>Unable to resist each other they soon found themselves back in each other's arms with nothing between them but a tangled lace of sheets and legs.  She had never felt so content, it just felt right being with him.  He couldn’t believe this woman lying next to him was really her.  They spent the afternoon enjoying each other.<br>“I can feel it, it’s getting closer,” he told her as she laid next to him with her head on his bare chest.  She knew it wasn’t far off and it scared her.  “It’s been done before, he said as he kissed her forehead, “nothing to worry about”.  She tried to push the worry from her mind.  <br></p><br><p>Twenty years ago his only kidney failed.  Thankfully his mom was a good match; she was able to give him the gift of life for the second time.  They were told her kidney would give him ten years.  He beat those odds.  Now, twenty years later he knew he was living on borrowed time.  His next transplant was not far off.  <br></p><br><p>“I’ll be glad when we don’t have to hide anymore,” she said as she reluctantly extracted herself from his arms, it was time to leave.  As they were about to walk out the door she gently tugged on the back of his jacket.  “Kiss me one more time before we go.”  He grinned down at her as he pulled her close.<br></p><br><p>“I think I’ve caught something,” he told her the next day.  A week later the doctor told him it was a sinus infection.  “I should be better in a few weeks,” he assured her.  Time went by but he wasn’t feeling any better.  She heard from him less and less.  He was sleeping a lot.  She grew more concerned with each passing day; five days had gone by and she had not heard from him.  <br></p><br><p>On the sixth day she finally heard from him.  Relief washed over her, but only for a moment. “I’m in the hospital, in the ICU.  They tell me I was barely alive when I was brought here.  They still don’t know what it is.”  <br>He spent the next eight months in and out of hospitals.  It took three of those months for them to diagnose the cancer caused by the drugs he had been taking every day for twenty years to prevent his body from rejecting the donor kidney. </p><p>Cancer. </p><p>“It’s curable, I’ll beat this,” he told her.<br></p><br><p>Sick with worry she had lost a lot of weight and darkness engulfed her days.  Having to pretend nothing was wrong when she was dying on the inside.  It was killing her.  She couldn’t visit him.  There was no one to tell her how he was doing. Her only connection with him was her phone. </p><p>She was on the outside and she couldn’t even see in. Her desperation turned into depression.  She had never felt so helpless in her life.  <br></p><br><p>Chemo treatments and dialysis consumed his life.  Then the pneumonia came.  Another thirty days in the hospital.  They sent him home and told him they expected he would be off the oxygen in about a month.  The good news was that they thought the cancer was gone.  <br>One evening in early August she was scrolling through her Facebook feed when she saw it.  She froze. The floor seemed to come right out from under her feet. She could not breathe.  Panic gripped her whole body.  No!!  This couldn’t be happening!  She read the post over and over.<br>It was a picture of his smiling face with the words Rest in Peace written on it.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p>
