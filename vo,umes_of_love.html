Lauren chirped endlessly about everything and anything that popped into her mind.  There was no need for the radio. The streets of downtown were alive with other cars, ferrying people to and from their own destinations. <br> “There it is,” I said as I nodded toward the glass and brick structure that resembled a government office building.  One would not imagine that once inside, it would reveal a vastly different story.<br><br>As a young girl, this was one of my favorite places to be.  I can recall riding my bicycle there on summer days.  I loved walking between the endless rows and rows of colored spines.  The ride home was always filled with eager anticipation as I desperately tried with one hand to keep my bicycle upright and my cadence steady, while balancing the weight of my assemblage in the other.  I knew soon I would be immersed in another world.  I moved a lot as a young adult, a new city, state, even country every couple of years. It was always the first thing I did after getting unpacked.  I found the local library, got myself a library card and checked out a pile of books.<br><br>I angled the car between the others and we made our way up the wet concrete sidewalk toward the building.  The statue that greeted us out front brought a smile to my face.  There were two young girls cast in bronze, one perched atop a stack of thick books, the other standing next to her, leaning her elbows on the stack as they were immersed in a book that lay opened on the girl’s lap. We stopped for a moment to appreciate the figure before heading inside the building. I silently wondered for a moment how difficult it would be to get it into the bed of the truck.  I pushed the felonious thought from my mind as we pulled the heavy glass doors wide and stepped inside. <br><br>We were greeted by an immense hall that branched in three different directions.  We started to examine the legend of the building that was hanging on the wall to our right.  “Let’s not look at this, let’s just go and discover what’s in there,” Lauren said as her gaze swept down the artery that led into the quiet of the main area of the library.  A few steps later we were rewarded with the most amazing children’s section I have ever experienced in a public library.  Adorned in bright colors, with gallons of natural sunlight pouring in through the windows surrounding the large room that was filled to the brim with long shelves bursting with books.  A menagerie of colorful stuffed animals were keeping watch over us as we walked slowly through the room, drinking everything in.  Our whispered choruses of excitement were endless.  Through the window, I caught a glimpse of the reading garden. Much to my disappointment, the sign on the door leading out to the garden read: Closed for the season.  We’ll be back in the spring to check it out.<br><br>Rounding the corner leading out of the children’s area I had my sights set on the main section of the library when Lauren caught up with me, “It’s over here mom, look.”  I turned to find what we came in search of, the puzzle swap!  The little nook held boxes of jigsaw puzzles you could borrow on the honor system.  We checked out the puzzles for a quick minute before heading into the heart of the library where we discovered the most creative, engaging, displays of book selections.  Every turn revealed a new nook that contained an upholstered armchair that was begging you to curl up in it with a book and get lost in the afternoon.  The teen section was jammed with copies of all the latest best sellers and a bank of computers reserved just for teens.  In the adult fiction section, we were amazed at the abundant array of audio books available to check out.  Out of curiosity, we looked to see how many Stephen King books were shelved there.  I’m not sure but I would have to say that every book he has penned was in that room.<br><br>“You ready to check out the second floor,” I asked Lauren who nodded, “let’s go!”  At the top of the stairs, we passed a glass-enclosed computer center and just ahead was the reference librarian.  When I was a kid that’s what I wanted to be when I grew up.  The thought of spending entire days in a library surrounded by books was exciting to me. I spotted the genealogy room as we rounded the corner.  Family history research is something we enjoy doing together. We headed to the room without discussion, it was dimly lit and soothingly quiet. The dusty, well-worn spines of old city directories dated back to the early 1900’s. Spiral bound books of varying sizes and colors stood in a corrugated line on the beige metal shelf. Each one containing a carefully annotated family story and lineage of a local family. As we quietly made our way around the room I showed Lauren old, tattered phone books, immigration lists, and volumes of passenger lists filled with the names of hopeful people looking for a new start in our country.  We even found old yearbooks from all the local high schools. Lauren plucked one from the shelf, it was dated 1987.  She laughed as she flipped through the pages, “everyone looks the same to me.”<br><br>The second floor was also home to several study rooms, a quiet reading room, an endless supply of resource books, every magazine and newspaper you could think of. The spaces that weren’t occupied by shelves were dotted with modern workstations for studying and several old, darkly stained, thick oak tables large enough to spread a newspaper out on. The most surprising thing about this library is that it was truly quiet. Quiet like libraries used to be.  Those who were talking were doing so in hushed whispers. It was so peaceful. As we were making our way back to the puzzle swap area to decide on a puzzle to take home, I realized that the only thing that was missing from this library was the smell of old books.<br><br>We walked out of the Alice &amp; Jack Wirt Public Library each wrapped up in our own thoughts about the afternoon with huge smiles on our faces.  I thought about the experiences I had as a young girl with books and the library, and how it felt to spend time there fingering through the long drawers of card files searching for information for a school report.  It’s a lot different today with the Internet at our fingertips.  Instead of convincing a neighborhood parent to drive you and your friends to the library and drop you off for the afternoon, kids sit in their rooms, alone, tapping questions into a Google search. When I think of Google, I think of cold, solitary, text on a bright screen. You don’t get to feel the small victory of actually finding the book you want waiting on the shelf for you. You aren’t rewarded with the smell of a book, old or new, when you open it. You can’t feel the physical measure in your hand of how far you have read on a computer screen. A print book is a physical reminder of your intellectual journey.  The book never changes.  Web sites change daily. The library has changed over time but one thing has remained constant, the books housed inside it.</p>
